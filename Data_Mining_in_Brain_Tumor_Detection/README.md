# Data Mining in Brain Tumor Detection

Group project completed as part of a Master’s-level course.

## Project Overview
This project explores the use of data mining and deep learning techniques to identify indicators of brain tumors from MRI images. Using publicly available datasets, the goal is to evaluate whether predictive models can improve the accuracy and efficiency of tumor detection to support timely diagnosis and treatment.

## Approach
- Analysis of brain MRI image datasets from public sources
- Application of deep learning–based classification methods
- Structured development, testing, and evaluation workflow

## Evaluation
Model performance is assessed using standard classification metrics, including:
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score  

## Data
The project used publicly available brain MRI image datasets sourced from Kaggle.

The dataset consisted of labeled MRI images across the following categories:
- 3,079 normal images
- 281 meningioma tumor images
- 5,908 pituitary tumor images

The image data is not included in this repository due to size constraints.
