# Data Mining in Brain Tumor Detection

Group project completed as part of a Master’s-level course.

**Objective:**
Develop and evaluate predictive models to identify brain tumors from MRI images.

**Description:**
This project applies data mining and deep learning techniques to classify brain MRI images into normal and tumor categories using publicly available medical imaging data. Model performance is evaluated using standard classification metrics.
The dataset consists of labeled MRI images across the following categories:
- 3,079 normal images
- 281 meningioma tumor images
- 5,908 pituitary tumor images

Image data is not included in this repository due to size constraints.

This repository is shared for academic reference and archival purposes. No claim of sole authorship is made.

**Key Skills / Tools:**
Python
Deep learning for image classification
Medical image data processing
Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

**Status:** Archived / academic project
