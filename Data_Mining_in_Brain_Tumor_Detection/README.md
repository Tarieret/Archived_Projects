# Data Mining in Brain Tumor Detection

Group project completed as part of a Master’s-level course.

## Project Overview
This project explores the use of data mining and deep learning techniques to identify indicators of brain tumors from MRI images. Using publicly available datasets, the goal is to evaluate whether predictive models can improve the accuracy and efficiency of tumor detection to support timely diagnosis and treatment.

## Approach
- Analysis of brain MRI image datasets from public sources
- Application of deep learning–based classification methods
- Structured development, testing, and evaluation workflow

## Evaluation
Model performance is assessed using standard classification metrics, including:
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score
