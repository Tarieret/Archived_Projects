# Loan Payment Prediction with SVM

**Objective:**  
Predict loan repayment status (default vs. no default) using Support Vector Machines (SVM).

**Description:**  
This project demonstrates a classical machine learning approach to financial risk prediction. Data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation were performed using Python libraries. The project highlights the workflow for building, tuning, and assessing an SVM classifier.

**Key Skills / Tools:**  
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, numpy)  
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering  
- Machine Learning (SVM)  
- Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)

**Status:** Archived / academic project
